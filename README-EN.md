## Disclaimer

Currently the project is in prototype stage and is not meant for general use. However, you're welcome to contribute, since the code is meant to be as universal as possible for easy deployment in any environment.

The project is primarily focused on Sweden, but expansion to other countries is possible in the future.

## About

GodResenär is a project meant to make public transportation more attractive by using crowdsourcing and gamification. How it's meant to work:

1. In every public transportation system, problems and flaws can happen. The more complex system is, the higher risk for those.
2. Passengers can participate in finding and reporting the flaws by using GodResenär - mobile application that has all the tools needed for high-quality reports.
3. Passengers report the problems directly to company using Godresenar and vote for other reports made by fellow passengers, all of them are posted in a "flow".
4. The company reports the problem to companies responsible for specific area, where flaw was detected (Buses, bus stops, vending machines.).
5. The responsible company makes sure to fix the issue if it's possible.
6. Passengers get rewarded with points for reports and extra points for accepted ones.
7. Overall quality of public transportation increases as problems are solved and timetables are optimized. 
8. More people get attracted to using public transportation as it's quality increases.

More information about the concept can be found in the [thesis the project was originally made for](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-471&pid=diva2%3A1436753&c=4&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=Lazarev&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all)

## To-do List

- [ ] Add code comments (in English)
- [ ] Complete the prototype:
  * [ ] Rewrite User code 
  * [x] Implement sample point shop
  * [ ] Implement voice messages for reporting
  * [ ] Implement video messages for reporting
  * [ ] Connect report sending process to sample report "database"
  * [ ] Create registration process and sample user database
 - [ ] Redesign logotype
 - [ ] Redesign report page 

Things that are not prioritized at the moment:

- iOS version (Due to lack of MacOS and iOS devices)
- Back-end (For managing reports, users, shop etc) - will possibly be created later
- UX/UI redesign - possible in the future
